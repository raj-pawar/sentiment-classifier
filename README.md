Training a sentiment classifier on movie reviews and tweets
I have used the bag of words method to train the classifiers where a particular number of words in the datasets have been created into features for each instance containing a True/False value to indicate the presence/absense of words in it. I chose 3000 words for most of the classifiers after removing stop words and punctuations. Further, I tried to increase accuracy of classifiers by considering 3000 most common words for creating features
